How to launch the app:

1 - Install docker and docker compose
2 - Start kafka: docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
3 - Make sure you have python3 installed
4 - Launch frontend.sh (it will also create venv and fetch dependencies)
5 - Launch backend.sh in separete shell
6 - Go to http://localhost:5000/ and post some text


How it works:

Fronted posts all messages directly to kafka, using remote address as partition
key

Backend consumes all messages from the topic accoring to the consumer's group 
offset.
